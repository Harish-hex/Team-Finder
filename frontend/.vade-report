## Vercel Speed Insights Integration Complete

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for this Next.js project.

### Changes Made

**1. Installed Package**
   - Added `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 via npm
   - Updated package.json and package-lock.json with the new dependency

**2. Updated Root Layout (app/layout.tsx)**
   - Imported `SpeedInsights` from `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
   - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after `<Analytics />`
   - Placement follows best practices for Next.js App Router (13.5+)

### Files Modified
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights import and component
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new package and its dependencies

### Implementation Details
- **Next.js Version**: 16.0.10 (supports App Router)
- **Router Type**: App Router
- **Package Manager**: npm (package-lock.json present)
- **Integration Method**: Used `@vercel/speed-insights/next` for automatic App Router integration
- **Component Placement**: Inside `<body>` tag, after existing `<Analytics />` component

### Notes
- The SpeedInsights component is now properly integrated and will automatically track performance metrics
- No additional configuration required - the component works out of the box
- The component is placed alongside the existing Vercel Analytics component for consistent monitoring
- Pre-existing build issue related to missing Supabase environment variables is unrelated to this integration
- ESLint is not configured in the project, so linting verification was skipped

### Verification
✅ Package installed successfully  
✅ TypeScript import added correctly  
✅ Component added to root layout  
✅ Changes staged with git  
✅ All lock files updated properly

The integration is complete and ready for deployment. Speed Insights will begin collecting performance data once deployed to Vercel.
